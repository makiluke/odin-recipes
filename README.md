I have recently decided to consolidate some of the knowledge I have been learning in the WGU computer science program.

While WGU provided me a strong mathematical, and theoretical understanding of computers and software, I still feel 
that my experience in development, especially front-end, is weak. I hope to achieve the following goals by the end of 
the Odin Project:

1. Increase my Git, and file structuring abilities
2. Understand HTML and CSS at an intermediate level, so I have less friction in implementing features to applications.
3. Develop strong skills in React.
4. Increase my knowledge of databases, in particular, Postgres and MongoDB.
5. Increase my efficiency in creating web applications.
